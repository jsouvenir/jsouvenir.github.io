              I lived in Aymar City for 663 years<br>
              I was married to a hot high elf but lost her when i was 300 years old.<br>
              After those 300 years i spent 363 years studying potions to craft something to resurrect my wife.<br>
              I became profound in alchemy.<br>
              In search of a res for my wife I overheard two elfves talking about (item used for resurrection?)<br> 
              I tracked down the map which was thought to have said item. <br>
              When the city found out, they said I had become obsessed with the idea of resurrecting my wife<br>
              I was banished from Aymar city because i had spent 363 years trying to resurrect my wife<br>
              <br>
              Desert Arc:<br>
              I was then teleported to the Tombstone Desert<br>
              I then started creating potions with what I could and selling them to nearby towns living as a nomad.<br>
              I met a strange old man who taught me the ways of divination for 1 year.<br>
              I created a house using private sanctum which required me to cast the same spell in the same spot for a year.<br>
              I then lived in my sanctum for 1 year with the purpose of mastering my spells so I could find said item <br>
              <br>
              Prologue:<br>
             I then left to the town which would make me the most money, Canta and did mercenary work for a year to train my spells in battle.<br>
             I met a couple friends along the way doing odd jobs such as Skoll and Novik.<br>
             After I felt experienced enough I took Skoll, Novik, Dakota Boone and Elizabeth to find this lab in the black zone.<br>
